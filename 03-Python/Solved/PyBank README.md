# PyBank Analyis

## Purpose
This activity's goal is to analyze the data and compute each of the sum of the period's "Profit/Losses" on a net basis, the average of the variations in "Profit/Losses" for the entire period, the day and amount when profits increased by the most overall, and the day and amount when profits dropped by the most overall.

## How I did
I used Python to read in a CSV and analyze the financial records of a company

## Actionable Insights
The total profit of the entire period is $22,564,198, with the greatest increase in profits being $1,862,002 which occurred in August. The greatest decrease in profits occurred in February, with a loss of profits in the amount of $1,825,558, which made the average change a loss of $8311.11.
