# PyPoll Analyis

## Purpose
This assignment's goal is to assist a small town in modernizing its voting procedures by calculating the total votes cast, compiling aÂ list of the candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate earned, the total votes each candidate received, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## How I did
I used Python to read in a CSV and analyze votes

## Actionable Insights
In all, 369,711 people cast ballots in this election. Diana DeGette won the selection with a total of 272,892 votes, or 73.812% of the total. Charles Casper Stockham came in second with 85,213 votes, or 23.049%, while Raymon Anthony Doane came in third with 11,606 votes, or 3.13%.
